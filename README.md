# Craigslist Discord Bot README

## Overview
This Discord bot scrapes Craigslist for free items and wanted posts, matches them based on similarity, and sends the results to a Discord channel. It's built with Python, using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `difflib`, `csv`, `discord.py`, `pandas`, and `asyncio`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Discord account and bot token
- Basic knowledge of creating and managing Discord bots

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [project-directory]
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 discord.py pandas
```

## Configuration
1. **Discord Bot Token:**
   Obtain a Discord bot token and replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` in the script with your actual token.

2. **Channel and URL Setup:**
   Replace `CHANNEL_ID_PLACEHOLDER`, `FREE_SECTION_URL_PLACEHOLDER`, and `WANTED_SECTION_URL_PLACEHOLDER` with your Discord channel ID and Craigslist section URLs.

## Running the Bot
Start the bot by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

## Features
- **Craigslist Scraping:** Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape Craigslist.
- **Matching Logic:** Utilizes `difflib.SequenceMatcher` for comparing post titles.
- **Discord Integration:** Sends summaries and individual matches to a Discord channel.
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling for web requests and Discord interactions.

## Customization
- You can modify the command prefix, bot token, channel ID, and URLs in the script.
- Adjust the similarity threshold in `find_matches_with_links` for custom matching logic.
- Customize the message format sent to Discord in `send_results_to_discord`.

## Limitations
- The bot's functionality is dependent on Craigslist's HTML structure, which is subject to change.
- It does not support real-time monitoring and needs to be run manually.
