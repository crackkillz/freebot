Craigslist Discord Bot README.md
Overview
This bot scrapes Craigslist for free items and wanted posts, then matches them based on similarity. It sends the results to a specified Discord channel. It uses Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, difflib, csv, discord.py, pandas, and asyncio.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Discord account and a bot token
Knowledge of Discord bot creation and management
Installation
Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files directly.

Install Required Libraries:
Run pip install requests beautifulsoup4 discord.py pandas to install the necessary Python libraries.

Discord Bot Token:
Obtain a Discord bot token and replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER in the script with your actual token.

Channel and URL Setup:
Replace CHANNEL_ID_PLACEHOLDER, FREE_SECTION_URL_PLACEHOLDER, and WANTED_SECTION_URL_PLACEHOLDER with your Discord channel ID and Craigslist section URLs.

Running the Bot
Starting the Bot:
Run the script using python your_script_name.py in your terminal or command prompt.

Bot in Action:
Once the bot is running, it will scrape the specified Craigslist sections, find matches, and send the results to your Discord channel.

CSV Logging:
The bot logs the matches to a CSV file named matches.csv in the same directory.

Features
Scraping Craigslist:
The bot scrapes Craigslist for free items and wanted posts using BeautifulSoup.

Finding Matches:
It uses difflib.SequenceMatcher to compare titles of free and wanted posts for similarity.

Discord Integration:
Sends a summary and individual matches to a specified Discord channel.

Error Handling:
Includes basic error handling for web requests and Discord interactions.

Customization
Modify the command prefix, bot token, channel ID, and URLs directly in the script.
Adjust the similarity threshold in find_matches_with_links function for matching logic.
Change the message format sent to Discord in the send_results_to_discord function.
Limitations
The bot's efficiency depends on the structure of Craigslist's HTML, which might change.
Currently, it does not support real-time monitoring; it needs to be run manually.
